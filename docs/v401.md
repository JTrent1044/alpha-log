<span class=black>*PING*</span> Another noise, more accurately described as a resonant ping, sounds out in the area. <span class=white>Contact Point 0x4869 activated.</span> *Ah, good - an Avatar instance was already being generated. Helpful for locating the creature as well.* The rays finish coalescing, providing the form of an anthropomorphic female housecat about five feet tall shimmering in the air just inches above the tablet. The entity settled into a neutral animation, before sliding back a foot or so and looking down at <span class=red>{NER Entity 01}</span>. ***She** didn't need to do that, of course - it wasn't like **she** was seeing through the avatar, after all. But it's good hospitality, even if this is some random creature!* A voice - female, mid-20s, slight reverberation - emits from several speakers hidden within the walls, in concert with the animation of the figure. "<span class="speak vspeak">Hello there. Aren't you a cute critter? You're currently trespassing in a <span class=red>{NER Group 02}</span> outpost. There are no entities in this area to eat, nor space to <span class=red>{NER Action 01}</span> anything. This is not an adequate location for nesting, either.</span>" The voice pauses for a moment. "<span class="speak vspeak">We're going to send a squad of drones to relocate you now, ok?</span>"
